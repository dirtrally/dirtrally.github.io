        <p>Dear all,</p>

        <p>I am very sad to tell you that Dirt Rally will be closed down due to many problems we faced recently, especially the start of 3rd season. It was more than awful. Our apologize.</p>

        <p>That's definitely a hard decision, but there is no way to go further without having more resources and time working on this project since it's not our full time job. We also don't want to make people even more angry due to those problems we can't fix at this time.</p>

        <p>We've played 2 official great seasons (4 awesome beta seasons) and I do hope that you liked it as much as we did.</p>
        <p>In the next couple of weeks we will see which direction Dirt Rally as a project should take. We will definitely try to inform you via email about every decision we make.</p>

        <p>There are couple of options:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to go open source, so anyone could contribute making Dirt Rally better and better (though we need to clarify how to achieve this)</li>
        <li>invite more people to the team, developers, designers, customer support, moderators, administrators, etc.. so they could help us to handle everything.</li>
        <li>to be bought by someone who has resources and time and money to run this project.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>When should we come back? We don't know yet, but dirtrally.net as a domain will be online and you can always reach us via email info@dirtrally.net.</p>

        <p>Feel free to share your feelings in the comments field below.</p>

        <p>Once again, that's sad and we're sorry about it.</p>

        <p>Giedrius and the team</p>
